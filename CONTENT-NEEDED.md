## =Ý CONTENT THAT NEEDS FINALIZATION

### 1. **Morpheus8 Treatment Pricing**

**Current Status:** Showing "POC" (Price on Consultation)

**Location:** `components/PremiumTreatments.tsx` (lines 12, 21, 30)

**What's needed:** Decide on pricing strategy:

**Option A:** Keep "POC" - encourages consultation bookings

**Option B:** Add specific pricing from consultation, example:
- Morpheus8 Face: £XXX
- Face & Neck Package: £XXX
- Full Body Treatment: £XXX per area

**Recommendation:** Keep "POC" to encourage consultations and allow for personalized pricing

---

### 2. **AssessmentTool Content** (Optional Update)

**Current Status:** Still references CO2 laser concerns

**Location:** `components/AssessmentTool.tsx`

**What's needed:** Update assessment questions to be Morpheus8-specific:

**Suggested changes:**
1. Skin concerns ’ Focus on laxity, texture, scars, wrinkles
2. Treatment goals ’ Tightening, contouring, rejuvenation
3. Recommendation logic ’ Point to appropriate Morpheus8 packages

**Action:** I can update this if you'd like, or you can leave as-is for now
